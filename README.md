# Hacker-Rank

### Solutions to basic [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) problems.

This repository is mostly for atypical solutions.

The Hacker Rank problems are learning tasks and fun problems, some submitted by the open developer community, that are solved algorithmically and programmatically.
People from all over submit and discuss solutions in the **Discussions** forum.

Solutions are language-agnostic and can be written in[^1]:

${\color{#555555}C}$

${\color{#f34b7d}C++}$

${\color{#178600}C-Sharp}$

${\color{#375eab}Go}$

${\color{#b07219}Java \space 7/8/15}$

${\color{#f1e05a}JavaScript \space (node/js)}$ 

${\color{#F18E33}Kotlin}$

${\color{#000000}Lua}$

${\color{#4F5D95}PHP}$

${\color{#3572A5}Python \space 3}$

${\color{#198ce7}R}$

${\color{#701516}Ruby}$

${\color{#ffac45}Swift}$

${\color{#2b7489}TypeScript}$

And more.
The available languages depend on the problem.
